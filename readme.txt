In this code, you copy the text from image you provide automatically.

When you run autocopy.py, it will ask for image, formats could be anything (but should be image),
after you provide the image, its gonna print the text from image to terminal and gonna say (Text has been copied to clipboard!),
imageToText.py file is original python code, autocopy.py is update version of it.
Thanks.
